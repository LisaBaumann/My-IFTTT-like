# ðŸŒ± Database

The database makes it possible to store the user's information (email, password, email, name, surname), but also all the services to which he has connected and the actions / reactions he has chosen. We chose the MongoDB database because it uses the NoSQL language which, unlike the SQL language, is not rigid and allows flexibility in terms of data type.
